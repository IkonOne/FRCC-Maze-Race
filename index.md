# Resources

These resources are in the rough order in which they should absorbed.  Anything marked Extra is for those that would like to dive deeper into the related subject.

* Arduino: [Get an IDE and follow some directions to get code running](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* Arduino: [Fitzring](http://fritzing.org/home/) is an application that will make it easier to try out different setups without requiring access to the school robot.  [It may be possible to run actual Arduino simulations on as well](http://tech.memoryimprintstudio.com/arduino-control-led-with-fritzing/)

# Guidelines for Success

The best way to ensure your success to to break the problems down into their smallest components and then order them based on priority.  For example, the robot has to move to compete in either of the competitions, so make it move first.

Also, don't reinvent the wheel.  There are many people who have solved these problems before you, and many of them have shared their solutions to some extent.  Seek them out!
