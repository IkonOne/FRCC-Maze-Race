# Rules Line Follower

A. **Objective**

1. Contestants will use a standardized robot to follow a black line on a white background, without losing the line, navigating several 90 degree turns and several points where the line intersects itself at right angles.  The robot to complete the cours in the fastest time is the winner.  If none of the robots complete the course, the robot which reached the furthest point wins.

B. **Rules for the Course**

1. Contestants will be given three attempts and the best time of the three will be thier time.
2. Time will be measured from the time the front of the robot crosses the starting line to the time the front of the robot crosses the finish line.
3. Time will be measured by electronic gate or by judge with a stopwatch.  The time recorded shall be the final time.
4. A robot which wanders off the arena edges shall have it's current run terminated and the time recorded will be DNF(Did Not Finish).  A robot is deemed to have wandered out of the arena if any part of the robot has moved completely off the arena.
5. Any robot which loses the line must reaquire the line at the point where it lost the line or earlier.

    1. Sensors may be connected to the Board of Education Shield with jumper wires in any configuration.
    2. Servos may be connected to the Board of Education Shield with jumper wires or with the already attached servo connectors in any configuration.  The wires attached to the servos may not be modified.
4. Additions to the robot shall not protrude 14cm from the robot in any direction.
