# Description

The FRCC RoboRace is a competition organized by the Front Range Community College Computer Science Club designed to encourage participants to push their STEM skills limits.  There will be two main events, the Line Follower race and the Maze Solver race.  The events are designed such that a single, well designed robot could compete in both competitions.

# Events

* [**Student** Line Follower](rules-line-follower#Student)
* [**Student** Maze Solver](rules-maze-solver#Student)

# Intro to Computer Science Students

A special Student class in both events is made for Front Range Community College Students.  This class will allow Students to participate using the school owned Parallax BoE-Shield-Bot.  There will be no entrance fee for this class and it is available to all currently enrolled FRCC Students.

**Note: Students currently enrolled in the Intro to Computer Science class will be given priority when scheduling time to work with the Parallax BoE-Shield-Bot.**

# Guidelines for Success

The best way to ensure your success to to break the problems down into their smallest components and then order them based on priority.  For example, the robot has to move to compete in either of the competitions, so make it move first.

Also, don't reinvent the wheel.  There are many people who have solved these problems before you, and many of them have shared their solutions to some extent.  Seek them out!
