# Maze Solver Rules

A. **Objective**

1. Contestants program a standardized maze solving robot, competing to solve a maze and repeat it's shortest path in the fastest time.

B. **Rules for the Maze**

1. The maze is composed of multiples of an 18 cm x 18 cm unit square. The walls of the maze are 5 cm high and 1.2 cm thick (**assume 5% tolerance for mazes**). Thus, the internal navigable area within a square is 16.8cm, not 18cm. The maze comprises up to 16 x 16 unit squares, for a total maze size of up to 2.88m square. The outside wall encloses the entire maze.
2. The start of the maze is located at one of the four corners. The start square is bounded on three sides by walls. The start line is located between the first and its second squares. That is, as the robot exits the corner square, the time starts. The destination goal is the four cells at the center of the maze. The destination square has only one entrance.
3. Small square zones (posts), each 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm, at the four corners of each unit square are called lattice points. The maze is so constituted that there is at least one wall at each lattice point.
4. Multiple paths to the destination square are allowed and are to be expected. The destination square will be positioned so that a wall-hugging robot will NOT be able to find it.

C. **Rules for the Competition**

1. Contestants will be allowed 3 runs through the maze.
2. To complete a run, the robot must exit the starting square, enter the finish square, return to the starting square and finally enter the finish square a second time.
3. A run may be terminated at any time.  To terminate the run, the contestant must remove the mouse from the maze.  The run will be scored as a DNF (did not finish) and will count toward the total number of runs completed.
4. The contestant may not touch the robot at any time during a run.  If the contestant does touch the robot, the run must be terminated.
5. Time for each run will start when the robot crosses the start line and stops when the front edge of the robot crosses the finish line for a second time.
6. The start line is defined as the boundary between the starting unit square and the adjacent unit square.
7. The finish line is defined as the openning between the lattices of the finish square.
8. The robot may, after completing it's first run, continue to navigate the maze for an additional 3 minutes.  Contestants must inform the judges prior to their first run if they wish for their robot to continue to navigate the maze.
9. After the maze is disclosed, the contestant shall not feed any information on the maze to the robot or the program running the robot.
10. The operator may perform the following actions on the robot:
    1. Change switch settings (e.g. to change algorithms from turn left to turn right.  Entering data on maze size or content is not inclusive in this rule)
    2. Replace batteries between runs.
    3. Adjust sensors.
    4. Change speed settings.
    5. Make repairs.
