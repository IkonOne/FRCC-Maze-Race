# Club Roboticists

Welcome.  This page is directed specifically toward individuals who wish to build their own robots to race.

Rules for this event can be [found here](/rules/club-line-follower.html).

## Overview

This page has several objectives.  They are as follows:

1. Quickly introduce readers to the process of building a line following robot from scratch and touch on potential snags that may be hit.
2. Provide resources which readers can use to further knowledge and procure parts.
3. Provide a simple but effective project management framework to ensure that the project is completed in time.

## Basic Project Management

When given a non-trivial project that must be completed within a specific timeframe, it is often easiest to sit and think through the problem before attempting to start.  This will allow you to set milestones and spot potential problems before they arrise.

There are several skills in this method required to complete the project efficiently:

1. [Minimum Viable Product](#minimum-viable-product)
2. [Milestones](milestones)
3. [Define High Level Requirements](#define-high-level-requirements)
4. [Concept Ideas](#concept-ideas)
5. [Prototype](#prototype)
6. [Develop](#develop)

### Minimum Viable Product

The primary concern when completing a project is meeting requirements.  This is as true when you are completing your homework as it is when completing a project for work or a client.  So be sure that the first iteration of your completed project does that with as little work as possible.  When you approach a project like this you make sure that your customer is satisfied and that minimal time has been used.

However, that does not mean don't consider the future improvements.  You should.  Just don't implement them.  There are ways that you can design a final MVP that allows for improvement while still minimizing time investment.

### Milestones

The project due date is not the only date that matters.  It is important that you set milestones that must be achieved by specific dates to ensure that your project doesn't get delivered late.  Some example milestones for the club robot might be:

1. 4/6/2018 - Complete idea concepting and order components.
2. 4/13/2018 - Program microcotroller(MCU) for basic controls of motors and reading sensors
3. 4/20/2018 - Program MCU to follow the line, curves and crosses.
4. 4/26/2018 - Finish optimizing robot.

Personally, I prefer a pencil and paper gantt chart to visualize scheduling for small or medium projects.  They make it easy to break the high level requirements into smaller requirements and set completion dates for each.

### Define High Level Requirements

In this stage you will do just as the title suggests and devine your high level requirements.  These do not get down into the nitty gritty but try to ensure that all aspects of the project are accounted for.

Here is a basic list of requirements to get you started:

1. Create a robot that conforms to the rules.
2. The robot must be able to sense the line effectively.
3. The robot must be able to move and turn.
4. [Optional] The robot must be programmable.
5. The solutions employed must be simple to implement.

Don't spend too long here.  You can always come back and add/delete requirements.

### Concept Ideas

This is where you start to think about how you want your robot to resolve the defined requirements.  To complete this step, you will need to research on google, on this site and anywhere else that you can think of to come up with ideas.  Remember, there are billions of people on this planet and it is very likely that someone has already solved the specific problem you are trying to solve as well.  Use their knowledge just as you do in school.  The world is an oyster or something like that.

Concepted ideas might be:

* Use 2 gear motors to drive the car.
* Sketch out a rought idea of the layout of the car.
* List potential materials to use such as glues, fastening straps, bottle caps for wheels, etc.
* How might the sensors be layed out?  Are you using a premade sensor?

This proces is not the time to be opinionated.  Every idea is worth considering and it could be a good process to just write everything you come up with on a post-it and then organize them when done brainstorming.

### Prototype

Try out your ideas after you have concepted them.  Nobody wants to build an entire robot only to find out that the battery is too small to run the motors and the microcontrolls at the same time.  Be sure that each idea is actually feasible by prototyping it.  If it turns out that an idea doesn't work, try another one from your concepted ideas or concept new ideas.

The key idea here is to fail early and fail often.  The faster you fail, the faster you learn and the faster you progress.

So if one of the ideas you have is to drive motors using the analog pins on an Arduino, try that out before attatching the motors permanently to the robot.

### Develop

Finally build the robot.  By now, you should have a solid idea of what ideas you had that worked and can put them together to complete your project.  Do it.
