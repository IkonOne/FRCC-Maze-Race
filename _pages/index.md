# Description

The FRCC Robot Race is a competition organized by the Front Range Community College Computer Science Club designed to encourage participants to push their STEM skills to the limits.  The first Robot Race will be a line following robotics race.

# What is a Line Following Robot Race

It is a competition where individuals design and build robots that follow a line as fast as possible.  For an example, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omDkur_fk8).
